This is my first task at my internship
The objective of this task is to create a program that allows user to encrypt the message using caesar cipher (or Caesar Shifting)

steps:
This program asks for input from the user, and the user have to decide on the number of shifting
when the user inputs the text and shift number, then it asks for options. they are
i.) Encrypt
ii.) Decrypt
iii.) Exit

the input(text and shift number) remains same for both options
the user can choose any options and give input the text message accordingly and relay the encrypted message and the receiver can decrypt the message using the help of shiftnumber and encrypted text


this task has given me a clear vision on encryption and caesar cipher.
